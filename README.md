**Figma**

I formatted this project according to the [Figma brief.](https://www.figma.com/file/avLHzpJw2dmU2NaDATZ6CX/Sprint-5%3A-Around-The-U.S.-%2F-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**JavaScript**

For Project 4 I had to learn how to use const, querySelector, functions, textContent, toggle classes, and how to change values.

For Project 5 I expanded my knowledge of add event listeners, functions, and how to link html, css, and jS.

**Conclusion**

Thank you for reading and enjoy the site.
