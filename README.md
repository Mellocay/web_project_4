# Project 8: Around The U.S.

### Overview

This website contains picture cards that you can both remove and add, as well as an editable profile.  The forms are validated and enhanced for a pleasant user experience.  You can now exit a modal by pressing the escape key, clicking the close button, submit button, or outside the modal.

**Figma**

I formatted this project according to the [Figma brief.](https://www.figma.com/file/avLHzpJw2dmU2NaDATZ6CX/Sprint-5%3A-Around-The-U.S.-%2F-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**JavaScript**

For Project 4 I had to learn how to use const, querySelector, functions, textContent, toggle classes, and how to change values.

For Project 5 I expanded my knowledge of add event listeners, functions, and how to link html, css, and jS.

Project 6 was all about form validation and user experience.  I also worked with more complex even listeners.  

For Project 7, I had to dive deeper into my understanding of the code and why it works.  I had to simplify it and box it into classes and create modules.  

Project 8 divided the code up into even more modules.  They make the code easier to work with since each module has it's own function.

**Conclusion**

Thank you for reading and enjoy the site.
